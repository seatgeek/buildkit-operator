# Template Synchronization

Some of these templates (like the CRDs, webhooks, and RBAC) are based directly on files auto-generated by kubebuilder.
It's important that these templates are kept in sync with the generated files.

Whenever changes are made to the Helm chart, run `make validate-helm-templates`. If it fails, determine if the chart needs to be changed or if the validation script itself needs to be modified.
